Todo List

Refactors

Simplify the lexer: The lexer code is quite complex and could be simplified by using a more efficient data structure for storing rules.
Improve error handling: The error handling in the parser and lexer could be improved to provide more informative error messages.
Refactor the parser: The parser code is quite long and could be refactored into smaller, more manageable functions.
Use a more efficient data structure for the AST: The current AST implementation uses a lot of memory and could be optimized using a more efficient data structure.
New Functions

Implement a function to generate LLVM IR for a given AST: This function would take an AST as input and generate the corresponding LLVM IR.
Implement a function to optimize the generated LLVM IR: This function would take the generated LLVM IR as input and optimize it for performance.
Implement a function to generate machine code from LLVM IR: This function would take the optimized LLVM IR as input and generate the corresponding machine code.
Implement a function to run the generated machine code: This function would take the generated machine code as input and run it on the target machine.
New Features

Add support for more data types: The compiler currently only supports a limited set of data types. Adding support for more data types, such as structs and unions, would be a useful feature.
Add support for more control flow statements: The compiler currently only supports a limited set of control flow statements. Adding support for more control flow statements, such as switch statements and loops, would be a useful feature.
Add support for functions: The compiler currently does not support functions. Adding support for functions would be a major feature addition.
Add support for modules: The compiler currently does not support modules. Adding support for modules would allow users to organize their code into separate files and reuse code more easily.
Other

Improve the documentation: The documentation for the compiler is currently very limited. Improving the documentation would make it easier for users to understand how to use the compiler.
Add more test cases: The compiler currently has very few test cases. Adding more test cases would help ensure that the compiler is working correctly and catch any regressions.
Improve the build process: The build process for the compiler is currently very simple. Improving the build process would make it easier to build and distribute the compiler.
Consider using a more modern C compiler: The compiler is currently written in C and uses a lot of outdated features. Considering using a more modern C compiler, such as Clang or GCC, would allow the compiler to take advantage of newer features and optimizations.
